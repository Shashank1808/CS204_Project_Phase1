In this project, we aim to design a a RISC-V assembler. In the cpp code file, we have designed the assembler, which works on the functions given. 
First we process the instruction, then check the instruction from the map we have defined(which was mentioned in the project instruction). According to the instruction, it gives proper output, and if the instruction is wrong, it shows that the instuction is wrong.
When the instruction is correct, the ouput.mc file gets the respective machine code.
